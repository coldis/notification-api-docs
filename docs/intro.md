# What is NotificationAPI?

With NotificationAPI, software developers can implement any kind of notifications into their app in a matter of minutes. It works like this:

1. Setup and design the Notification in our dashboard ðŸ‘‰ [guide](https://docs.notificationapi.com/docs/quick-start/setup-the-notification)
2. Use our back-end SDK to trigger the notification ðŸ‘‰ [guide](https://docs.notificationapi.com/docs/quick-start/send-the-notification)

You can do other cool stuff too:

- [No code in-app notifications popup](https://docs.notificationapi.com/docs/guides/display-inapp-notifications)
- No code notification preferences for your users (coming soon)
