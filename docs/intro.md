# Intro

If you need to add notifications to your software, NotificationAPI is perhaps the fastest way to do it.

Think of it like: <b>Notifications-as-a-Service</b>

Out of the box, you will get:

- Various types of Notifications (email, in-app, SMS, call, ...)
- End-User Notification Preferences
- A dashboard to visually control & monitor notifications

## Let's Get Started:

1. Setup your dashboard & configure a notification ðŸ‘‰ [guide](https://docs.notificationapi.com/docs/quick-start/setup-the-notification)
2. Use our back-end SDK to trigger the notification ðŸ‘‰ [guide](https://docs.notificationapi.com/docs/quick-start/send-the-notification)
3. Optionally, use our front-end SDK to show in-app notifications or end-user preferences [guide](https://docs.notificationapi.com/docs/guides/display-inapp-notifications)
