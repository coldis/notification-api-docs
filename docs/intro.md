# What is NotificationAPI?

NotificationAPI allows software developers to implement any type of notifications (email, in-app, push, ...) and other related features such as notification management and feature flagging in a few lines of code. This is done by configuring your notifications in our dashboard, then adding and using our SDKs in your application.
