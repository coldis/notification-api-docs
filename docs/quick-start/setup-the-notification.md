# Setup the Notification

#### Prerequisite: [Create an account here](https://app.notificationapi.com).

:::info
After you create an account, the wizard takes you through this same guide. You can follow the wizard or refer to this.
:::

## 1. "Create Notification" from Dashboard

This configures the regular notifications your software sends. Example:

import NewNotification from '@site/static/newnotification.png';

<img src={NewNotification} />

## 2. Design (optional)

New notifications come with a default design which is good for demo purposes. You can go ahead to the [send the notification](send-the-notification) step.

Optionally, you can click the relevant tab, e.g. In-App, and visually customize the design.

import DesignNotification from '@site/static/designnotification-inapp.png';

<img src={DesignNotification} />
